https://directory.dupontregistry.com/explore/?type=event&sort=upcoming,San Francisco Chronicle International Auto Show,"747 Howard St, San Francisco, CA, USA","In 1958, unable to participate in the local domestic auto show, forward-thinking Bay Area import auto dealers decided to create their own exposition. Given the novelty and interest at the time in foreign made cars, the auto dealers’ idea proved to be a good one. For nearly two decades the Import Car Show, the precursor to what is now the International Auto Show, flourished and expanded at Brooks Hall and the Civic Center.
The globalization of the auto industry in the ‘60’s and 70’s marked a new era of automotive production and demand. Therefore, the Import Car Show broadened its scope to include the products of both the domestic and international manufacturers and was renamed the International Auto Show. In 1982, the show moved into its new home at the Moscone Convention Center in downtown San Francisco.
From the onset, the show was a tremendous success and recognized by the auto manufacturers as an integral component to selling their vehicles. Display space was in high demand and that demand required the auto show to expand its footprint.
Fortunately, in 1992, another hall was added to the Moscone Center expanding it to a total of 1.2 million square feet. The additional space allowed exhibitors to construct more elaborate displays to showcase their vehicles and provided spectators with a more spacious and inviting environment in which to view them. It also allowed the San Francisco International Auto Show to grow into what it has become today–the premier auto show in northern California and the only one held regionally that lures the dazzling, high-tech displays from the world’s major manufacturers. It is the second largest auto show in the western United States and the number one exhibition of any kind in northern California.
Now celebrating its 61st year, the International Auto Show, continues to grow. This year’s show, set for November 21-25, will fill the newly remodeled Moscone Center with exhibits in the north and south halls, the new south hall expansion, the Esplanade Ballroom plus the north and south lobby and driveway areas.
The latest in automotive innovation representing the work of the world’s major manufacturers will be on display at the show including the 2019 model vehicles, new introductions, the largest selection of electric, hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles plus the newest driver assist and connectivity technology.
In addition, there will be exotic sports cars, manufacturer Test Drives and special exhibits including an electric vehicle infrastructure display from PG&E, the Academy of Art University Classic Car Collection, and the San Francisco Auto Salon with modified and trend-setting cars. The Show will also include exhibits from the Aston Martin and Ferrari Clubs of America and an auto accessory booth area.
The San Francisco Chronicle 62nd Annual International Auto Show, presented by Golden 1 Credit Union and supported by the California New Car Dealers Association, promises to be the most spectacular ever.",,Nov 28 2019 10:00AM,Dec 02 2019 8:00PM,https://directory.dupontregistry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/sf-header.jpg,https://directory.dupontregistry.com/listing/san-francisco-chronicle-international-auto-show/,,,

It’s a celebration of everything Ferrari, from the marque’s latest offerings to the historic sports and racing cars that made it the brand it is today.
The five-day event includes track days, vintage races, a swap meet with many vendors, and the Concorso d’Eleganza finale. It’s said that getting a coveted Platinum here is more difficult than gaining a top award at the Ferrari Nationals, while many car owners who seek entry to the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance use the Cavallino as a gauge of whether their car is worthy of attendance.
Achieving a Cavallino Platinum can also add considerable value to a car, and as a result competition is fierce. If you want to see the best of the best Ferrari road and race cars, and hang out with other aficionados, the Cavallino Classic is just the ticket.",(561) 994-1345,Jan 22 2020 8:00AM,Jan 26 2020 6:00PM,https://directory.dupontregistry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cavallino-classic.jpg,https://directory.dupontregistry.com/listing/cavallino-classic/,mailto:classic@cavallino.com,,
